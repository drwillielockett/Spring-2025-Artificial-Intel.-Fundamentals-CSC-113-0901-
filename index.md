Version Two - use index.md
This time, we'll use a markdown file and apply a theme.
To do this:
Rename your index.html file to index.md
Upload a _config.yml like this one to the same place as the index.md 
 _config.yml
 (you should edit this file to change it to your name, and this is where you change the theme)
(optional) change the theme -- https://pages.github.com/themes/
Refresh in actions, and check it out!
